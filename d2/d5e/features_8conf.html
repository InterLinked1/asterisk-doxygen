; chan_local in combination with Answer to accomplish it.

[applicationmap]
; Note that the DYNAMIC_FEATURES channel variable must be set to use the features
; defined here.  The value of DYNAMIC_FEATURES should be the names of the features
; to allow the channel to use separated by '#'.  For example:
;
;    Set(__DYNAMIC_FEATURES=myfeature1#myfeature2#myfeature3)
;
; (Note: The two leading underscores allow these feature settings to be set
;  on the outbound channels, as well.  Otherwise, only the original channel
;  will have access to these features.)
;
; The syntax for declaring a dynamic feature is any of the following:
;
;&lt;FeatureName&gt; =&gt; &lt;DTMF_sequence&gt;,&lt;ActivateOn&gt;[/&lt;ActivatedBy&gt;],&lt;Application&gt;[,&lt;AppArguments&gt;[,MOH_Class]]
;&lt;FeatureName&gt; =&gt; &lt;DTMF_sequence&gt;,&lt;ActivateOn&gt;[/&lt;ActivatedBy&gt;],&lt;Application&gt;[,"&lt;AppArguments&gt;"[,MOH_Class]]
;&lt;FeatureName&gt; =&gt; &lt;DTMF_sequence&gt;,&lt;ActivateOn&gt;[/&lt;ActivatedBy&gt;],&lt;Application&gt;([&lt;AppArguments&gt;])[,MOH_Class]

;
;  FeatureName   -&gt; This is the name of the feature used when setting the
;                   DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable to enable usage of this feature.
;  DTMF_sequence -&gt; This is the key sequence used to activate this feature.
;  ActivateOn    -&gt; This is the channel of the call that the application will be executed
;                   on. Valid values are "self" and "peer". "self" means run the
;                   application on the same channel that activated the feature. "peer"
;                   means run the application on the opposite channel from the one that
;                   has activated the feature.
;  ActivatedBy   -&gt; ActivatedBy is no longer honored.  The feature is activated by which
;                   channel DYNAMIC_FEATURES includes the feature is on.  Use a pre-dial
;                   handler to set different values for DYNAMIC_FEATURES on the channels.
;                   Historic values are: "caller", "callee", and "both".
;  Application   -&gt; This is the application to execute.
;  AppArguments  -&gt; These are the arguments to be passed into the application.  If you need
;                   commas in your arguments, you should use either the second or third
;                   syntax, above.
;  MOH_Class     -&gt; This is the music on hold class to play while the idle
;                   channel waits for the feature to complete. If left blank,
;                   no music will be played.
;

;
; IMPORTANT NOTE: The applicationmap is not intended to be used for all Asterisk
;   applications. When applications are used in extensions.conf, they are executed
;   by the PBX core. In this case, these applications are executed outside of the
;   PBX core, so it does *not* make sense to use any application which has any
;   concept of dialplan flow. Examples of this would be things like Goto,
;   Background, WaitExten, and many more.  The exceptions to this are Gosub and
;   Macro routines which must complete for the call to continue.
;
; Enabling these features means that the PBX needs to stay in the media flow and
; media will not be re-directed if DTMF is sent in the media stream.
;
; Example Usage:
;
;testfeature =&gt; #9,peer,Playback,tt-monkeys  ;Allow both the caller and callee to play
;                                            ;tt-monkeys to the opposite channel
;
; Set arbitrary channel variables, based upon CALLERID number (Note that the application
; argument contains commas)
;retrieveinfo =&gt; #8,peer,Set(ARRAY(CDR(mark),CDR(name))=${ODBC_FOO(${CALLERID(num)})})
;
;pauseMonitor   =&gt; #1,self/callee,Pausemonitor     ;Allow the callee to pause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel
;unpauseMonitor =&gt; #3,self/callee,UnPauseMonitor   ;Allow the callee to unpause monitoring
;                                                  ;on their channel

; Dynamic Feature Groups:
;   Dynamic feature groups are groupings of features defined in [applicationmap]
;   that can have their own custom key mappings.  To give a channel access to a dynamic
;   feature group, add the group name to the value of the DYNAMIC_FEATURES variable.
;
; example:
; [myGroupName]         ; defines the group named myGroupName
; testfeature =&gt; #9     ; associates testfeature with the group and the keycode '#9'.
; pauseMonitor =&gt;       ; associates pauseMonitor with the group and uses the keycode specified
;                       ; in the [applicationmap].
