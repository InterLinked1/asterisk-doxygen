; Transports
;
; There are three different transports and protocol derivatives supported by chan_motif. They are in order of preference:
; Jingle using ICE-UDP, Google Jingle, and Google-V1.
;
; Jingle as defined in XEP-0166 supports the widest range of features. It is referred to as "ice-udp" in this file. This is
; the specification that Jingle clients implement.
;
; Google Jingle follows the Jingle specification for signaling but uses a custom transport for media. It is supported
; by the Google Talk Plug-in in Gmail and by some other Jingle clients. It is referred to as "google" in this file.
;
; Google-V1 is the original Google Talk signaling protocol which uses an initial preliminary version of Jingle.
; It also uses the same custom transport as Google Jingle for media. It is supported by Google Voice, some other Jingle
; clients, and the Windows Google Talk client. It is referred to as "google-v1" in this file.
;
; Incoming sessions will automatically switch to the correct transport once it has been determined.
;
; Outgoing sessions are capable of determining if the target is capable of Jingle or a Google transport if the target is
; in the roster. Unfortunately it is not possible to differentiate between a Google Jingle or Google-V1 capable resource
; until a session initiate attempt occurs. If a resource is determined to use a Google transport it will initially use
; Google Jingle but will fall back to Google-V1 if required.
;
; If an outgoing session attempt fails due to failure to support the given transport chan_motif will fall back in preference
; order listed at the beginning of this document until all transports have been exhausted.
;

; Dialing and Resource Selection Strategy
;
; Placing a call through an endpoint can be accomplished using the following dial string:
;
; Motif/&lt;endpoint name&gt;/&lt;target&gt;
;
; When placing an outgoing call through an endpoint the requested target is searched for in the roster list. If present
; the first Jingle or Google Jingle capable resource is specifically targetted. Since the capabilities of the resource are
; known the outgoing session initation will disregard the configured transport and use the determined one.
;
; If the target is not found in the roster the target will be used as-is and a session will be initiated using the
; transport specified in this configuration file. If no transport has been specified the endpoint defaults to ice-udp.
;

; Video Support
;
; Support for video does not need to be explicitly enabled. Configuring any video codec on your endpoint will
; automatically enable it.

; DTMF
;
; The only supported method for DTMF is RFC2833. This is always enabled on audio streams and negotiated if possible.

; Incoming Calls
;
; Incoming calls will first look for the extension matching the name of the endpoint in the configured context. If
; no such extension exists the call will automatically fall back to the "s" extension.

; CallerID
;
; The incoming caller id number is populated with the username of the caller and the name is populated with the full
; identity of the caller. If you would like to perform authentication or filtering of incoming calls it is recommended
; that you use these fields to do so.
;
; Outgoing caller id can *not* be set.
;
; IMPORTANT: Multiple endpoints using the same connection is *NOT* supported. Doing so may result in broken calls.

; Default template for endpoints, to be included in their definition
[default](!)
disallow=all
allow=ulaw
allow=h264
context=incoming-motif ; Default context that incoming sessions will land in

;maxicecandidates = 10 ; Maximum number of ICE candidates we will offer
;maxpayloads = 30      ; Maximum number of payloads we will offer

; Sample configuration entry for Jingle
;[jingle-endpoint](default)
;transport=ice-udp               ; Change the default protocol of outgoing sessions to Jingle ICE-UDP
;allow=g722                      ; Add G.722 as an allowed format since the other side may support it
;connection=local-jabber-account ; Connection to accept traffic on and send traffic out
;accountcode=jingle              ; Account code for CDR purposes

; Sample configuration entry for Google Talk
[gtalk-endpoint](default)
;transport=google         ; Since this is a Google Talk endpoint we want to offer Google Jingle for outgoing sessions
;connection=gtalk-account

; Sample configuration entry for Google Voice
;[gvoice](default)
;transport=google-v1       ; Google Voice uses the original Google Talk protocol
;connection=gvoice-account

; Additional options
; callgroup
; pickupgroup
; language
; musicclass
; parkinglot
